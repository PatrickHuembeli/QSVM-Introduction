The goal of supervised algorithm is to learn to predict these labels and to be able to generalize to unlabelled data of the same kind. After the training on MNIST, the algorithm should be able predict that an image of a 5 is actually labelled by a 5.

One example of such algorithms is the k-means clustering. There, the user specifies the number of clusters he wants to find in the data and the algorithm finds automatically the different clusters. Another example is the T-SNE algotrithm, widely used for data visualisation. This algorithm takes data in a high-dimensional space and tries to find some structure in the data, that can be visualized by the user in 2D or 3D. As an example, we show here the application of the t-SNE algorithm on the MNIST dataset. Even without labels, the different numbers separate nicley in different clusters."

For example, this one-dimensional dataset is not linearly separable. However, when embedding them in the two-dimensional space with the map $\\Phi: x \\rightarrow (x,x^2)$. The datas become again linearly separable. In the ducal formulation, one only has to compute the scalar product $ x_j^T x_k$, which after the embedding takes the form $ \\Phi(x_j^T) \\Phi(x_k)$. The pretty nice point of using the kernel trick is that one does not have to do the embedding if one knows the value of the the scalar product. An example is the gaussian kernels where the data are embedded in a high dimensional space and mapped to gaussians, where the scalar product can be computed analitcally. "

    "### Quantum SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a quantum SVM we will only used the quantum feature maps $\\mathcal{U}_{\\Phi(\\vec{x})}$ to translate the classical data into quantum states and build the Kernel of the SVM out of these quantum states. After calculating the Kernel matrix on the quantum computer we can train the Quantum SVM the same way as the classical SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining the Quantum Kernel**\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the quantum kernel is exactly the same as in the classical case. We take the inner product $K(\\vec{x}, \\vec{z}) = \\vert \\langle \\Phi (\\vec{x}) \\vert \\Phi(\\vec{z}) \\rangle \\vert^2 = \\langle 0^n \\vert \\mathcal{U}_{\\Phi(\\vec{x})}^{t} \\mathcal{U}_{\\Phi(\\vec{z})} \\vert 0^n \\rangle$, but now with the quantum feature maps $\\mathcal{U}_{\\Phi(\\vec{x})}$. The idea is that if we choose a quantum feature maps that is not easy to simulate with a classical computer we might obtain a quantum advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: _There is no proof yet that the QSVM brings a quantum advantage, but the argument the authors of [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11326.pdf) make, is that there is for sure no advantage if we use feature maps that are easy to simulate classically, because then we would not need a quantum computer to construct the Kernel._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature map**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the feature maps we use the ansatz $\\mathcal{U}_{\\Phi(x)} = U_{\\Phi(x)} \\otimes H^{\\otimes n}$, where $U_{\\Phi(x)} = \\exp \\left( i \\sum_{S \\in n} \\phi_S(x) \\prod_{i \\in S} Z_i \\right)$, which simplifies a lot when we (like in [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11326.pdf)) only consider $S \\leq 2$ interactions, which means we only let two qubits interact at a time.\n",
    "For $S \\leq 2$ the product $\\prod_{i \\in S}$ only leads to interactions $Z_i Z_j$ and non interacting terms $Z_i$. And the sum $\\sum_{S \\in n}$ over all these terms that are possible with $n$ qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we define the classical functions $\\phi_i(\\vec{x}) = x_i$ and $\\phi_{i,j}(\\vec{x}) = (\\pi - x_i)( \\pi- x_j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we write this ansatz for 2 qubits and $S \\leq 2$ we see how it simplifies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{\\Phi(x)} = \\exp \\left(i \\left(x_1 Z_1 + x_2 Z_2 + (\\pi - x_1)( \\pi- x_2) Z_1 Z_2 \\right) \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't get into details to much here, why we would take this ansatz. It is simply an ansatz that is simple enough an leads to good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we can define a depth of these circuits. Depth 2 means we repeat this ansatz two times. Which means our feature map becomes $U_{\\Phi(x)} \\otimes H^{\\otimes n} \\otimes U_{\\Phi(x)} \\otimes H^{\\otimes n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measuring the Quantum Kernel**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we need to extract the information about the quantum kernel again from the quantum circuit to feed it into the classical SVM algorithm. This is actual a non-trivial task, because we want to measure the overlap of two states $K(\\vec{x}, \\vec{z}) = \\vert \\langle \\Phi (\\vec{x}) \\vert \\Phi(\\vec{z}) \\rangle \\vert^2$ but there is a smart way to estimate this overlap, in [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11326.pdf) they used this circuit for that estimation. \n",
